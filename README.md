Naviter Oudie(IGC) as a FLARM device - setting

Many thanks to Lysupov ( https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/wiki ) for working on SofRF project.

I have Naviter Oudie(IGC) connected to Prime Edition Mark II ( based on third-party's hardware - TTGO T-Beam ) and working as a FLARM device. With this combination and correct setting is possible to view traffic arround me on Oudie display.

Everything is documented on wiki page https://github.com/ivonovak/SoftRF-Naviter-Oudie/wiki/Seting-SoftRF---Oudie(IGC)-as-a-FLARM-device
